### Data Flow

#### Client-Server Communication

   - Server processes requests and returns responses
   - JWT token is included in request headers for authenticated requests

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Client sends credentials to server
   - Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
   - Client stores token in local storage
   - Client includes token in subsequent requests

#### Database Interactions
1. **User Data**:
   - User credentials and profile information stored in User collection
   - References to created and saved activities stored in User document

2. **Activity Data**:
   - Activity details stored in Activity collection
   - Creator reference stored in activity document

3. **Discussion Data**:
   - Questions stored in Question collection
   - Answers stored in Answer collection
   - References between questions and answers maintained

### State Management
1. **Client-Side State**:
   - Apollo Client cache for GraphQL data
   - Local component state for form inputs and UI state
   - Authentication state stored in local storage and managed by AuthService

2. **Server-Side State**:
   - Database persistence for all data
   - JWT for maintaining session state

### Error Handling
1. **Client-Side Errors**:
   - Form validation errors displayed inline
   - API errors displayed as alerts or error messages
   - Network errors handled with retry logic or error pages

2. **Server-Side Errors**:
   - GraphQL error responses for validation and business logic errors
   - HTTP status codes for authentication and server errors
   - Error logging for debugging

### Responsive Behavior
- Desktop layout: Multi-column grid for activities and discussions
- Tablet layout: Reduced columns and adjusted spacing
- Mobile layout: Single column with optimized touch targets
